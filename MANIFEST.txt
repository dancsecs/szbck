Notes: 
------ 

Efforts have been made to follow standard go idioms except for standard error
handling.  Within functions continued processing is continued if and only if
no errors are reported with a single wrapped error being returned at the end
of each function.  This more easily enables achieving 100% coverage without
having to simulate every possible error many of which can be difficult or
impossible to simulate.  Good expected processing is qualified by no errors
being reported while the bad and ugly situation fall through to a single exit.

README.md is autogenerated from the template file README.md.gtm using the
Szerszam utility goToMD found at https://github.com/dancsecs/goToMD.  This has
not be executed as of yet and when executed will create the README.md file
based on the go package documentation found in the root main package.

Several addition Szerszam utility packages are used to implement:

custom logging:
    https://github.com/dancsecs/szlog

argument parsing:
    https://github.com/dancsecs/szargs

test helper functions:
